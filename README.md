# Coolest Super Power Comics

Hi, my name is Rob and this is my Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project.

I have modeled this site on another site, [comixology](https://www.comixology.eu/), of which I am a subscriber, and tried to make it my own while keeping the minimalistic functional approach.

There are still a few thing that I would like to do to this project but due to time constraints with work and home, I just wanted to get the site to a level that displays my understanding of the logic and the methodology behind creating a site like this. 

## UX

This site is for anyone like me that enjoys comics and would like a quick and simple way to purchase or access these comics.

Some user stories that I used are...

- A customer that adds a comic to the shopping cart then going to the cart decides they want to add another one of this comic to have multiple then continue on to the checkout page.

- Another story being a customer that adds a comic then in the shopping cart page decides they want to go back to the shop front page and look at other comics to add more to their shopping cart.

- Also the customer that wants to get both digital items and paperback in one order, they can ad their details in one session and complee the transaction.

## Features
 
In my projects I have my home shop page, which displays some comics available for purchase. Some are paperback and require shipping where others are digital and do not need to be shipped.

I have a shopping cart page which displays any comics added and allows the user to adjust the quantity of items in the shopping cart.

The user can also from here continue on to the checkout page or retunr to the shop front to continue searching for comics to add to the shopping cart.

I have a chekout page that allows the user to enter payment details using Stripe and also shipping details if the item requires it.

My project allows users that have an account to sign in and purchase items but also a guest user can also use this site and make purchases.

### Features Left to Implement

I would like in the future to update this site as I enjoyed this project. Some other ideas I would like to implement that I feel would add to the user experience would be...

- Adding Item details, so the customer can get a brief description of the comic and maybe see some pages from inside to see the artwork, as I appreciate sites that have this feature as being a sketch artist I appreciate seeing the art style and this can help sway my desicion in purchasing sometimes.

- I would also like to add some added account functions, such as possible social media links to post a comic that was purchased or sending an update to a friend on a new comic that has been released and to link it back to this site.

- Also one thig that I really wanted to add but again I did not have the time, a wishlist page would be very usefull for users that might want to get a collection together but cannot purchase all at once. 

- I would also like to add a sales page, to further aid the customer in seeing some items that interest them

- I would also like to use the search box to allow customers the use of this feature.

## Deployment

I have deployed my project using github to push to Heroku and the link to my github pages site is [Coolest Super Power Github Project](https://1208kelly.github.io/Full_Stack_Frameworks_with_Django_Milestone_Project_1208/)
